### Hi Everyone!  

Short and simple...I'm on Github to learn about how developers collaborate with one another to get somthing done and, most importantly, discover what subjects and projects interest me the most. 

### What am I curious about?  
Anything that has to do with wellness surrounding human beings. 
So nutrition, genes, cardiovascular system, and the brain.  
I am also weirdly interested in personal finances/economics. 

### Skill level?  
I am not a developer but I work in IT Tech Sales.  I work with a software portfolio that automates IT Operations.  I am trained as a bioengineer with a concentration in cell and tissue engineering and a minor in data analytics. 

### What am I looking for? 
A project that involves a subject I'm interested in and brings me joy.  
I can start small with going through the instructions on the README.md and raise an issue if I feel like instructions are not clear, read through other issues and comment on them, and lastly edit project for formatting purposes.
